Title: In-House Cultivation of Agar and Guar (The Structural Gels)
1. Agar (Algae-Based)
Species: Gracilaria or Gelidium.
Cultivation: Vertical Photobioreactors (PBR) using LED light and filtered rainwater.
Role: Provides the "thermo-reversible" setting property for the 3D-printed food (allows the meal to hold its shape).

2. Guar (Legume-Based)
Species: Cyamopsis tetragonoloba.
Cultivation: Hydroponic ebb-and-flow tables.
Role: The "Guar Gum" acts as a thickener and stabilizer, ensuring the 3D printer nozzle creates a smooth, continuous extrusion without "clogging" or "beading."
