Title: Circular Waste Management & Nutrient Recovery
1. Solid Waste: Frass (The "Revenue" Byproduct)
Collection: Automated vibrating sieves separate frass from larvae.
NPK Value: 4-2-2 (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium).
Utilization: 30% recycled for in-house fodder; 70% bagged for sale to SC agricultural partners.

2. Organic Plant Byproduct
Root Mats: The barley root mats (left over after mealworms eat the grass) are dehydrated, milled, and used as high-fiber "filler" for the food-grade packaging or as additional substrate for the beetles.

3. Biological Safety & Hygiene
UV-C Sterilization: All incoming water (rainwater) and outgoing frass are treated with UV-C light to prevent the introduction of mites or pathogens into the closed-loop system.
