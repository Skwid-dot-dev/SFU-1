Project Manna: My take on a self sustaining net positive autonomous food production. 


📌 Vision

Project Manna is an open-source blueprint for the Sovereign Food Unit (SFU): a net-positive, closed-loop food factory designed to produce high-nutrient, 3D-printed meals with zero recurring input costs.
By integrating insect protein cultivation, vertical hydroponics, solar energy harvesting, and thermal displacement, we are shifting the paradigm from "food aid" to "food sovereignty." Our pilot facility is designed for South Carolina, strategically positioned to serve the state's prison systems, homeless networks, and food-insecure corridors.
To test this proof of concept, we are blueprinting the systems for a Sovereign Food Pod (SFP): A micro build of the facilities first-principles to fit in a 40 ft High Cube Shipping Container. Details can be found in the SFP folder.

⚙️ The Circular Architecture
The SFU operates on a Five-Pillar Closed-Loop System:

1. The Biological Engine (Protein)
Species: Tenebrio molitor (Yellow Mealworm).
Process: An automated vertical rearing system that utilizes 1% of every harvest to self-perpetuate the beetle breeding stock.
Output: High-density insect flour (60%+ protein), fertilizer (Frass).
Synergy: CO2 is reused in the Fodder Loop for up to 25% additional growth gains.
Synergy: Frass is reused in the Fodder Loop eliminating the needs for fertilizers.

3. The Fodder Loop (Feed)
Process: Vertical Hydroponic Fodder (VHF) units growing barley and wheatgrass grass-mats in 7-day cycles.
Output: 70% of fodder is used as feed for the Engine, the other 30% is dehydrated and utilized as bedding for the engine.
Synergy: The mealworms' fecal matter (Frass) is processed into liquid nutrients to feed the hydroponic systems, eliminating the need for external fertilizers.
Synergy: CO2 is collected from the Mealworms area to boost growth rates.

5. The Fabricator (3D Printing & Stabilizers)
Stabilizers: In-house cultivation of Algae (Agar) and Guar (Gum) to serve as binding agents.
Printing: Industrial-scale 3D food extruders convert flour and stabilizers into "Nutri-Bricks"—palatable, nutrient-dense, shelf-stable meals tailored to specific caloric requirements.

6. Energy & Thermal Symbiosis
Solar Skin: Rooftop solar array coupled with industrial battery storage for 24/7 autonomy.
Thermal Loop: Waste heat from 3D printers and milling motors is captured and piped into the insect nurseries, while evaporative cooling from the hydroponic wing regulates the facility temperature.

7. The Revenue Layer (Subsidized Distribution)
Media-Packaging: Food packaging is 3D-molded from plant byproduct fiber and utilized as ad-space for Social Impact (ESG) partners.
Waste-to-Wealth: Excess Frass is sold to local South Carolina agriculture as premium organic fertilizer (NPK 4-2-2).

🗺️ South Carolina Pilot: "Project SC-Alpha"

The first SFU-1 is optimized for the I-95 / I-26 Interchange region.
Target Impact: Provide 30,000 free meals per month to the SCDC (South Carolina Dept. of Corrections) and regional "Food Desert" networks.
Economic Impact: Reduce taxpayer food-procurement costs by an estimated 85% within the first 24 months.

📂 Repository Structure

/Biology: Rearing protocols, FCR (Feed Conversion Ratio) data, and Beetle-replacement math.

/Engineering: CAD files for automated racks, 3D printer nozzle specs, and HVAC thermal loop schematics.

/Energy: Solar yield projections and battery discharge profiles for SC irradiance.

/Logistics: Distribution maps for SC interstate access and prison population data.

/Economics: Pro-forma spreadsheets for CAPEX/OPEX and Packaging Ad-Revenue models.

🛠 How to Contribute

We are looking for experts in:

Entomology: Optimizing Tenebrio molitor growth cycles and disease resistance.

Additive Manufacturing: Developing high-viscosity food-grade extrusion heads.

System Architects: Refining the CO2/Thermal exchange between the biological and mechanical modules.

Policy & Law: Navigating FDA GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) certifications for insect-based proteins.
