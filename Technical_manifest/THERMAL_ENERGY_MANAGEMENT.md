Title: Thermal Displacement & Energy Recovery Logic

1. The Thermal Balance Sheet
Heat Sources: Solar Inverters, 3D Printer Stepper Motors, Milling Friction, and Bio-fermentation.
Heat Sinks: Mealworm Nursery (requires constant 28°C/82°F), Algae Tanks (requires constant 20°C/68°F).

2. Recovery Infrastructure
Heat Exchangers: Liquid-to-Air cross-flow exchangers mounted on the 3D printer exhaust and milling motor housings.
Phase Change Material (PCM): Integrated into the nursery walls to maintain temperature stability during night-time battery operation.
HVAC Integration: A 5-ton Industrial Air-source heat pump utilizes the "cool" side to regulate the Algae/Guar lab and the "hot" side to maintain the Mealworm rearing environment.
