Title: Photovoltaic Generation & Irradiance Mapping

1. South Carolina Solar Profile
Location Focus: Orangeburg/Santee, SC (Interstate Nexus).
Peak Sun Hours: Average 4.8 to 5.2 hours/day.
System Size: 150kW – 200kW Industrial Rooftop & Canopy Array.
Panel Type: Bifacial Monocrystalline (N-Type) for high efficiency in SC’s high-heat summers.

2. Generation Math
Daily Production: ~720kWh – 960kWh (Average).
Facility Load: ~600kWh/day (Including 3D printers, LED grow lights, and HVAC).
Net Positive Goal: The system is designed to over-produce by 20% to account for winter cycles and to sell excess power back to the SC grid via Net Metering.
