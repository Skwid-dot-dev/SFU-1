Title: Tenebrio Molitor Management & Replacement Protocol

1. Environmental Parameters (South Carolina Optimized)
Temperature: 27°C – 29°C (80°F – 84°F).
Humidity: 60% – 70%. Note: SC humidity helps, but high-flow ventilation is required to prevent mold in the substrate.
Substrate: Sterile wheat bran or in-house processed barley husks (from the fodder wing).

2. The 100% Self-Sustaining Loop (The "1.5% Rule")
To ensure the factory never stops, a specific portion of larvae must be protected from harvest:
The Nursery: 500,000 Darkling Beetles.
Harvest Cycle: 8–10 weeks from egg to larvae harvest.
Replacement: 1.5% of every harvestable tray is moved to the Pupation Chamber.
Selection: Only larvae over 30mm in length are selected for pupation to ensure high-vigor genetic stock.

3. Lifecycle Stages
| Stage | Duration | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Egg | 7–10 Days | Incubated in beetle trays with fine mesh floors. |
| Larvae | 8–10 Weeks | Primary harvest window for 3D printing flour. |
| Pupae | 7–14 Days | Non-feeding stage. Requires dark, zero-vibration environment. |
| Beetle | 2–3 Months | Breeding stock. Fed high-moisture fodder mats. |
