Title: Integrated Biological & Mechanical Flow (The Loop)

Core Philosophy: The SFU-1 is a "Bio-Mechanical Utility." No energy or matter leaves the system without being utilized for a secondary or tertiary purpose.

The Loop Topology:

Input Wing: 150kW Solar + Rainwater Collection + Barley Seeds.

Conversion Wing (The Engines):

Vertical Fodder: Sunlight/LEDs + Frass-Nutrients -> Barley Biomass.

Insect Rearing: Barley Biomass -> Protein (Larvae) + Fertilizer (Frass) + CO2.

Fabrication Wing (The Factory):

Bio-Refinery: Larvae/Algae/Guar -> Flour & Binder.

3D Printing Array: Flour/Binder/Heat -> Formed "Nutri-Bricks."

Distribution Wing: 3D-molded packaging + Logistics.
