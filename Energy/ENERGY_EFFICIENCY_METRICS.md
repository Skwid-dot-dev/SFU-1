Title: Consumption vs. Production Audit

1. Major Load Profiles (Estimated)
LED Grow Lights (Fodder/Algae): 15kW (12-hour cycle) = 180kWh/day.
3D Printing Array (12 Units): 10kW (8-hour production window) = 80kWh/day.
HVAC & Climate Control: 12kW (Variable) = ~150kWh/day.
Mechanical (Milling/Mixing): 5kW = ~40kWh/day.
TOTAL DAILY LOAD: ~450kWh.

2. Efficiency Multipliers
CO2 Enrichment: By siphoning insect CO2 to the plants, we reduce the "Light-Hours" needed for plant growth, saving ~15% in LED energy.
Gravity-Feed Systems: Whenever possible, water for hydroponics is pumped to the top of the vertical racks and uses gravity to cycle through, reducing pump-motor run time.
