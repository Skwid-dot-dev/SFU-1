Title: Chemical-Free Binder Extraction (Agar & Guar)

1. Guar Processing (The Binding Gum)
Source: In-house hydroponic Guar beans.
Mechanical Extraction:
De-husking: Beans are split and the germ is removed via impact milling.
Milling: The remaining endosperm is fine-ground into a powder.
Hydration: Powder is mixed with warm water to create a high-viscosity "printing gel."

2. Agar Extraction (The Structural Gel)
Source: Vertical photobioreactor-grown Gracilaria algae.
Thermal Extraction:
Washing: Harvested algae is cleaned in filtered rainwater.
Pressure Cooking: Boiled at 121°C for 2 hours in the SFU-1 Steam Loop.
Filtration: Liquid is filtered through a 10-micron mesh and allowed to gel.
Dehydration: Gelled agar is sliced and dried using waste heat from the Solar Inverters, then ground into powder.
