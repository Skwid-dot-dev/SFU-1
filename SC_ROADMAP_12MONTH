🚀 SC-Alpha: The 12-Month Launch Roadmap
We have mapped out a 4-phase "Biological and Industrial Inoculation" plan for our first facility in the I-95 / I-26 Orangeburg-Santee corridor.
Phase 1: Foundation & Governance (Months 1–3)
Goal: Establish the physical and legal footprint.
Month 1: 📍 Site Acquisition: Secure 6,000 sq. ft. warehouse with high-bay ceilings in the SC Interstate Nexus.
Month 2: 📜 Legal Shielding: File for SCDA (Dept. of Agriculture) Wholesale Food Processor permits and finalize FDA GRAS self-affirmation.
Month 3: ☀️ The Power Skin: Installation of the 150kW Solar Canopy and 250kWh Battery Array. The facility goes "Off-Grid Capable."
Phase 2: Biological Inoculation (Months 4–6)
Goal: Scaling the "Engine" and the "Feed."
Month 4: 🌱 Hydro-Fodder Launch: Initiate the 7-day Barley Fodder cycles. First harvest of green biomass.
Month 5: 🪲 The Inoculation: Introduction of the first 5 million Tenebrio molitor larvae and the 500k Darkling Beetle breeding core.
Month 6: 🔄 The Frass-Loop: First collection of mealworm frass to fertilize the Hydroponic and Guar/Agar labs. Zero-waste cycle achieved.
Phase 3: The Fabricator Integration (Months 7–9)
Goal: Calibration of 3D printing and stabilizer extraction.
Month 7: 🌡️ Thermal Sync: Connect the 3D printer water-jackets to the Beetle Nursery floor-heating loop.
Month 8: 🧪 Binder Lab: First in-house extraction of Agar and Guar gum. Final "Printing Paste" viscosity calibration.
Month 9: 🖨️ Small Batch Testing: 3D printing the first 1,000 "Nutri-Bricks." Nutrient density auditing and shelf-life stability tests.
Phase 4: Full-Scale Sovereignty (Months 10–12)
Goal: Supplying the network and generating revenue.
Month 10: 📢 Ad-Network Launch: First "Packaging Media" contracts signed with ESG partners. QR-code ad stamping begins.
Month 11: ⛓️ The SCDC Pilot: First delivery of 10,000 meals to the South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC) regional hubs.
Month 12: 🗺️ Statewide Expansion: Facility reaches "Net-Positive" status (Revenue + Energy Savings > OPEX). We begin the blueprint for SFU-2.
