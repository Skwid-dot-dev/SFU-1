Title: Institutional Partnership & Prison System Integration
1. Nutrition Standards
The South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC) requires meals to meet specific RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance) metrics.
Our 3D printing software (The Fabricator) ensures every Nutri-Brick meets 100% of the SCDC "Religious Diet" and "Medical Diet" requirements, providing a one-stop solution for complex inmate populations.

2. The "Savings-Based" Contract
Strategy: We propose a No-Cost Capital Contract. We build the facility (via the initial $1.5M investment), and the state agrees to a long-term procurement contract at $0.20 per meal (covering maintenance). This saves the state millions while providing us a guaranteed distribution channel.

3. Social Liability
By providing the same high-quality protein to homeless networks and schools that we provide to prisons, we eliminate the legal argument of "cruel or unusual" punishment regarding food quality. It is a "Community-Standard" super-food.
