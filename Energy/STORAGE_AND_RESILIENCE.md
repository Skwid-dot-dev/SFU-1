Title: Battery Management & Disaster Autonomy

1. Storage Hardware
Capacity: 250kWh Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) Battery Array.
Reasoning: LFP is chosen for its 10-year+ lifecycle and safety (non-combustible) in food-grade environments.

2. Disaster Mode (SC Hurricane Protocol)
Grid-Independent Operation: In the event of a grid failure (common in SC coastal/inland storms), the SFU-1 enters "Life Support Mode."
Prioritization: Power is diverted from the 3D printers to the Climate Control and Fodder Irrigation systems to ensure the biological "Engine" (the mealworms) survives until the sun returns.
Community Asset: The facility acts as a "Micro-Grid" hub where local emergency services can recharge equipment.
