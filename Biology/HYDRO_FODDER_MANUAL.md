Title: Vertical Fodder System (VFS) for Insect Feed
1. Crop Selection: Barley Grass
Barley is chosen for the highest Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) and rapid 7-day growth cycle.
Yield: 1kg of seed yields 7kg of green biomass.
Nutrient Profile: High moisture content (eliminates the need for separate water sources for the insects).

2. The "Frass-Tea" Irrigation
Input: Mealworm Frass (feces) collected from the rearing trays.
Process: 1kg of Frass is steeped in 20L of rainwater for 24 hours.
Output: Organic nitrogen-rich liquid fertilizer used in the flood-and-drain hydroponic cycles.

3. Atmospheric Symbiosis
CO2 Sourcing: The mealworm rearing room is high in CO2 from insect respiration.
CO2 Scrubbing: This air is piped into the Hydroponic Wing, where the barley grass "scrubs" the CO2, accelerating plant growth by 25% compared to ambient air.
