Title: Federal Regulatory Framework for Insect-Based Human Food
1. FDA Status (GRAS)
Classification: The FDA currently treats insects as "food" if they are raised specifically for human consumption and processed under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP).
GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe): We will pursue a self-affirmed GRAS status for Tenebrio molitor flour based on existing safety data from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which has already cleared mealworms for human consumption.

2. HACCP Plan (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point)
The facility will operate under a strict HACCP plan to mitigate:
Biological Hazards: UV-C sterilization of all water/inputs; blanching protocols to ensure zero pathogen survival.
Allergens: Mandatory Labeling. Insects share a protein relationship with shellfish. All Nutri-Bricks must carry the warning: "Warning: Contains insect-based protein; individuals with crustacean or shellfish allergies may have a cross-reactive response."

3. USDA Involvement
While the FDA regulates the food itself, the USDA oversees the vertical fodder (barley/wheat). Our "in-house feed" model follows USDA organic-equivalent standards by utilizing zero synthetic pesticides.
