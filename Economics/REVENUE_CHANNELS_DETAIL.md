Title: Deep Dive: Advertising & Byproduct Monetization

1. The "Social Impact" Ad Network

The packaging is not just a container; it is a communication platform.
Format: QR-coded, 3D-molded fiber lids.
Target Advertisers: Law firms, educational tech (GED prep), vocational training services, and corporate ESG departments.
Engagement: Unlike digital ads, this is a physical, 15-minute interaction during meal consumption.

2. Frass: The "Black Gold" of Agriculture

Mealworm Frass is a high-value NPK 4-2-2 fertilizer containing Chitin, which triggers natural pest resistance in plants.
Local Market: South Carolina’s boutique peach and tobacco farms.
Value-Add: By processing frass in-house into a liquid concentrate, the revenue per kg can be tripled.

3. Carbon Sequestration

The SFU-1 is a "Bio-Refinery."
CO2 emitted by insects is captured by the vertical fodder mats.
Plant-based waste is recycled back into the system.
This circularity qualifies for federal and state green-energy tax incentives.
