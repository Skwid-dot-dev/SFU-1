Title: The Thermodynamic Exchange (Waste Heat Recovery)

1. Thermal Zoning
The "Hot Zone" (82°F): Beetle Nursery and Larvae Racks.
The "Mechanical Zone" (High Friction): 3D Printer Motors and Milling Hub.
The "Cool Zone" (68°F): Algae/Guar Labs and Packaging Storage.

2. The Recovery Cycle
Heat Capture: Water-jackets on 3D printer extruders and the industrial mealworm mill capture friction heat that is usually wasted.
Heat Transfer: This thermal energy is moved via a Hydronic Loop (insulated pipes) to the floors of the Beetle Nursery.
Result: The energy required to heat the insect breeding grounds is reduced by 70%, as the mechanical "waste" of the factory becomes the "fuel" for the biology.
