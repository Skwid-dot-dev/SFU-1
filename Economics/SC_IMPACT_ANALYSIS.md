Title: South Carolina Displacement Case Study
The Problem:
South Carolina currently faces a significant hunger gap, specifically within the Department of Corrections (SCDC) and rural "Food Deserts" along the I-95 corridor.
The Solution Economics:
SCDC Food Spend: The state spends approximately $1.15 to $1.45 per meal in correctional facilities.
The SFU-1 Offer: We provide a 1,000-meal/day capacity at a total unit cost of $0.05 per meal (post-revenue).
Taxpayer Savings: Implementing one SFU-1 unit saves the SC taxpayer approximately $300,000 per year compared to traditional food procurement.
Payback Period: The initial $1M investment (CAPEX) is fully recouped through state savings and revenue within 3.3 years.
