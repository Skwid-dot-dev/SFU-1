Title: South Carolina Departmental Compliance (SCDA & SCDHEC)
1. South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA)
Commercial Feed License: Required for the production of mealworm fodder.
Food Safety License: The facility will register as a "Wholesale Food Processor" with the SCDA.

2. SCDHEC (Dept. of Health and Environmental Control)
Facility Permitting: The SFU-1 will be permitted as a food manufacturing plant.
Waste Management: Because the facility is "Net-Zero Waste," we bypass many traditional industrial waste-water regulations.

3. Right to Farm Act
In South Carolina, our facility qualifies under "Controlled Environment Agriculture" (CEA). We utilize SC’s pro-agriculture laws to protect the facility from local zoning challenges regarding insect rearing.
